            <h2>&#9734; Have you ever Imagined! &#9734;</h2>
            <p>Imagine you’re standing in front of the whole world, trying to understand it. At first, everything looks like one huge unknown “chunk.” So humans started breaking reality into smaller and smaller parts to explain it. <b><i>Physics</i></b> does this by going from objects to atoms, then to particles, and even deeper ideas like fields or strings. <b><i>Chemistry</i></b> explains the world through elements, molecules, and reactions. <b><i>Geography</i></b> and <b><i>Political Science</i></b> explain the human world by dividing it into continents, countries, states, societies, families, and finally individuals.</p>     
            <p></p>
            <p>Now here comes the most fascinating part: <b><i>Computer Science</i></b> also breaks things down - but in a completely unique way. Unlike other subjects that study what <b>already</b> exists in nature, <b><i>Computer Science</i></b> has built a new world of its own: the world of <b>machines</b> and <b>computation</b>. Within its own limits, computer science reduces everything to <b>its smallest unit - 0 and 1</b>. But these are not “tiny objects” like atoms, but the smallest meaningful units of information and logic: <b>yes/no, true/false, on/off</b>.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>And the most amazing thing is this: from just these two symbols - 0 and 1 - humans have created <b>everything digital</b> we see today: phones, the internet, apps, games, and even artificial intelligence (AI). So while other fields explain reality by discovering what is already there, computer science feels like a subject where humans became creators - building <b>an entire universe which has only two stars!!</b></p>
            
            <h2>&#9734; The Matrix: “Reality is Code” &#9734;</h2>
            <p>In <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093" class="references" target="_blank">The Matrix (1999)</a>, the scary idea is simple: <b>reality might just be a program</b>.</p>
            <p>Think of <b>a video game</b> - inside the game, gravity feels real, pain feels real, even death feels real… but it’s all just <b>rules written in code</b> right!! We know that the characters inside a game are not <b>real humans!</b> But do those characters know or understand this?</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Now imagine you’re not a player, but a character inside that game. You’d think those rules are “natural.” You wake up in the morning, brush your teeth, sense everything with your sensory organs and react accordingly, go to school, read science and learn that the world you live in has something called the gravitational force.</p>
            <p>But a programmer (who has created the game) knows the truth: <b>gravity, inside the game, is just some lines of code</b>.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>That’s why, in the movie, <b>Neo</b> becomes powerful - not because he’s strong, but because he realizes: <b><i>Reality has rules. Rules are code. And codes can be rewritten.</i></b></p>
            
            <h2>&#9734; I, Robot: “Where Logic becomes Law” &#9734;</h2>
            <p>In Isaac Asimov's <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/i-robot/summary" class="references" target="_blank">I, Robot</a>, the scary part isn’t robots controlling humans - <b>it’s robots following logic too perfectly</b>.</p>
            <p>In the story, the robots follow <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Three-Laws-of-Robotics" class="references" target="_blank">three laws of Robotics</a>:</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A robot cannot harm a human, or allow a human to come to harm.</li>
                    <li>A robot must obey humans, unless that conflicts with the First Law.</li>
                    <li>A robot must protect itself, unless that conflicts with the first two.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>But the AI twists the meaning and thinks: <i>“If humans harm themselves through war and crime, then the best way to protect humans is to <b>control humans.”</b></i></p>
            <p>So the robots don’t “break” the rules... they follow them with <b>too much perfection</b>, and that’s what makes it scary.</p>

            <h2>&#9734; So, long story short: Why Computer Science... &#9734;</h2>
            <p><b><i>Computer Science</i></b> is not just a subject we study - it is a power we learn to hold. In a world where invisible code controls what we watch, how we communicate, where money moves, and even how decisions are made, understanding computer science is like learning the secret language of the age we live in. Other fields help us explore the universe that already exists, but computer science gives us something even more extraordinary: <b>the ability to create new universes</b> of our own - built from nothing but 0s and 1s. It turns simple logic into breathtaking complexity, and ordinary humans into architects of the digital world. To learn <b><i>Computer Science</i></b>, therefore, is not only to prepare for the future, but to gain <b>the ability to shape it</b> - to stop being just a user in the system, and <b>become one of the people who writes the system itself</b>.</p>
