            <h2>&#9734; Computer Language: </h2>
            <p>Don't ever misunderstand that as the English-speaking people invented this 'Compuverse', computers, therefore, understand their native language and work accordingly.</p>
            <p>I mean, of course, computers know how to do something or how to follow common instructions. We can talk to AI, type whatever we want in the search bar, and get our expected results more or less. But that doesn’t mean machines “understand” our words the way humans do.</p>
            <p>Computers don’t literally understand what you are asking or saying. They only understand their own languages - machine language, unique combinations of 0s and 1s.</p>
            <p>And yes, by language(s) I mean plural. There are thousands of computer languages in this world, though only around 10-12 among them are widely popular for being user-friendly. You may have heard about something called Python or Java in terms of computers... Well, those are computer languages.</p>
            <p>These languages are basically two things combined:</p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Human-readable instructions (written using English-like words and symbols), so programmers can write and understand code.</li>
                    <li>A system that translates those instructions into the computer’s real language - machine code (0s and 1s).</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>While using all these languages, you literally tell your computer to function in a certain way (the first point), and the special ability of these languages translates your instructions into computers' language or machine language.</p>
            <p>So, don't only think that computer is only about games, and MS word, and YouTube, and Powerpoint, and Excel... there is literally a universe with its own solar system underneath the hood... inside your tiny mobile... and once you learn how to control that, you get a glimpse of your potential to change your reality...</p>

            <h2 class="recursion">&#9734; Recursion: </h2>
            <p class="subtitle">(For those who have some prior knowledges about Computer Science, especially programming laguages like Python or C)</p>
            <p style="margin-top:30px;">In computer coding, the idea of recursion is often found very confusing</p>
            <p>Imagine what would happen if you could create someone in your life who could do your work exactly the way you do—maybe a cloned version of you. And you could call that person whenever you feel lazy while doing something repetitive. You would do something only once, and for the rest, you could rely on that person… or more precisely, on yourself (cloned).</p>
            <p>But wait… if that cloned person is a complete version of you, then it also thinks like you do, right? And so, it might also feel lazy while doing the rest of your monotonous work, right? So it might create another cloned person to do the rest of its job. And that clone (which is again a version of you) can repeat the whole process again.</p>
            <p>That’s recursion.</p>
            <p>In computer programming, this idea of recursion is amusingly confusing, but at the same time widely popular and useful. In recursion, there is always a base case—a point where the process stops. It’s like every cloned version of you does the first part of the work and assigns the remaining part to another clone, until there’s nothing left to do. For example, if you have to do a task 10 times, you might need 9 clones plus yourself—and after that, creating more clones is no longer necessary.</p>
            <p>Even if the concept sounds easy to understand, implementing it in code can be difficult. But in this case, one of my friends has attempted to explain it in simple terms. So, if you are a dummy like me and find recursion difficult to implement, go to this website and take a look:</p>
